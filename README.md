# SentinelAI - Ongoing Developement
SentinelAI is a SaaS platform with complete solution to audit security of web sites assisted by AI
It scans web sites for an extensive list of vulnerabilities with advanced scripts powered by a diversified list of ML models for maximum detection
AI models are fine-tuned to such type of data from scans to provide an audit that is comprehensive yet advanced to detect patterns and probability of system failure/attack

Initial prototype features:
Web Discovery: Advanced website domain recognition and information scrapping (WHOIS, DNS, Robots.txt, public files, security files and mail addresses, bug bounty program existence, location, ...etc) aswell as scanning ports and other techniques applied on the target domain.
Vulnerabilities Scan: Offensive techniques applied on target website to detect vulnerabilities, map attack surface, define how to exploit findings and structure data.
